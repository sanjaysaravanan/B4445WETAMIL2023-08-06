  DB, Table, Columns( Specification of the datatypes ), Rows

  Database:

    create DB
      https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp
      syntax: CREATE DATABASE databasename;

      Eg: Create Data base for School Management

      CREATE DATABASE school-mgmt;

    SHOW DATABASES;
    SELECT name FROM sys;
  
  Table:
    create table

      rows(inserted, updated, deleted) ( data ), columns(alter) ( specification of the type of data )

      https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_table.asp

      CREATE TABLE table_name (
          column1 datatype,
          column2 datatype,
          column3 datatype,
        ....
      );

      CREATE TABLE Students (
        StudentId int,
        LastName varchar(255),
        FirstName varchar(255),
        Class int,
      );

    ALTER TABLE:
      statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
      ALTER TABLE table_name
      ADD column_name datatype;

      ALTER TABLE table_name
      DROP COLUMN column_name;

      ALTER TABLE table_name
      RENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;

      ALTER TABLE table_name
      MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;

    CRUD on single Record or Row in a table:
      CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

    READ:
      all data
        SELECT * FROM movies;

      single column
        SELECT title FROM movies;

      multiple columns
        SELECT title, director FROM movies;

      Filtering:
        where:
          select movies from year 1995
          select movies except with ids 1, 5, 8
          select the movies which contains WALL in titl string

      Sorting:
        order by:
          select * from movies order by Title asc/desc;
        limit:
          order and limit the enteries
        offset:
          where to start the limit count

        distinct:
          without duplicate
          list all directors in alphbetical

      aggregate function:
        max, sum, min, avg, count

      alias:
        as syntax to convert the column name

      group by:
        aggregate function by combing row with condition
        Reference: https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_aggregates

        how many movies each director has directed
          SELECT count(Title), Director as Movies_Count FROM movies GROUP BY Director;
        
        how many minutes each director has directed

    
    insert a record:
      INSERT INTO tablename
      (column, another_column, …)
      VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
            (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …),
            …;
    
    UPDATE:
      UPDATE mytable
      SET column = value_or_expr, 
          other_column = another_value_or_expr, 
          …
      WHERE condition;

      change director for a movie

      update movies set Director='John Lasseter' where Title="A Bug's Life";

    DELETE Row from table:
      DELETE FROM mytable
      WHERE condition;
